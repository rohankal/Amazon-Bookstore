# Sample Amazon Bookstore
This code implements a miniature and simplified version of an Amazon-esque store. By running the Makefile with "make" and running the executable with "./amazon database.txt", you will be able to follow the on-screen instructions and add products to users' carts, view their carts, and buy items in their carts.
